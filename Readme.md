kPlaylist is free of charge for commerical and non-commercial use. 
	However, the included JW FLV player (jeroenwijering player) requires 
	a license for commercial use. That means, if your site is using the 
	flash player in a commercial setting, you'll need to aquire a 
	license for the JW player from this site: http://www.longtailvideo.com/

kPlaylist makes your music archive available via the WEB. Play music, 
	search, create and edit playlists from everywhere by just having a webbrowser 
	and a audio player. Features include logon, accounts, account classes, user editor, 
	automatic installation (MySQL), upload, download, archive download and much more.

Script information:
	Also note, this is a script under construction and strange things may happen,
	though it hasn't on the machines we tested it on. The system writes by
	default only to a MySQL database, but can also be set up to write
	id3v1 tags (mp3 files.).

	Due to the legal responsibility however, we have to note: There
	are NO GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER other than this application will
	occupy certain amount of space on the device you put it.
