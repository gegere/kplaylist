kPlaylist is free of charge for commerical and non-commercial use. 

However, the included JW FLV player (jeroenwijering player) requires 
a license for commercial use. That means, if your site is using the 
flash player in a commercial setting, you'll need to aquire a 
license for the JW player from this site: http://www.longtailvideo.com/
